# Kickstarting with Excel</br>

A deep dive into Excel, as we know, Excel is a tool that can be used across all Organizations areas, including from household budgeting to complex financial analysis. Learning from the intricacies of Excel will draw on (and enhance) skills we may have already, like computer literacy, data literacy, and quantitative reasoning. Including advanced Excel features formulas, charts, and pivot tables.

## Overview of Project </br>
From our dataset we know  the play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, we wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that we already combed through, we visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 


### Purpose
The main purpose of this assignment is to visualise 2 goals</br>

1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart</br>
2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart


## Analysis and Challenges </br>
Here's a quick look at the Kickstarting Analysis and Challenges of this Project, including the following tasks:

Import data into a table for analysis.</br>
Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas.</br>
Generate and interpret pivot tables.</br>
Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.</br>
Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.</br>
Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.</br>
Interpret common Excel visualizations</br>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date</br>

For this analysis, we looked at theatre projects (parent category) with the launch dates grouped by calendar month – this grouping showed the clearest pattern, leading to the observations in the “results” section below. Note that the spreadsheet tab “Outcome Based on Launch Date” allows the user to look at other parent categories by using the drop down list in cell B2; however, the Theater observations had a distinct pattern most likely to be relevant to this project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals</br>

We grouped projects into buckets based on goal ranges, and calculated the percentage in each project that were successful, failed, or canceled. We are presenting results for the “plays” subcategory, but the user can extend this to any subcategory using the drop-down menu on cell L3.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered </br>

Biggest challenge was filtering the pivot table to visualize the relationship between parent category and years, adding the correct dataset into the Columns, Rows and Values.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?</br>
From our line chart we can see that the months of May and June both have a greater success rate. A bar chart wouldn't be able to convey this information in the same manner.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?</br>
 Our outcomes based on Goals measures using line chart of central tendency work in practice help us finding the mean and median for each dataset's (the failed and successful campaigns).

- What are some limitations of this dataset?</br>
 We are drawing conclusions using some of the information presented in this dataset. There may be other interesting factors that are not included here – for example, there is no information about the age/gender/educational level of the person or entity launching the campaign, and how many of the contributors came in purely from Kickstarter as opposed to having another relationship with the project sponsor (e.g. family, fraternity/sorority affiliations, etc.)

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?</br>
Box Plots</br>
Pie Graph</br>
Column Graph</br>
Line Graph</br>
Area Graph</br>
Scatter Graph</br>
